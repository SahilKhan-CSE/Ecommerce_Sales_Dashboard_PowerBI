# Ecommerce_Sales_Dashboard_PowerBI

Project Description:-

The project's focus was on developing an interactive Power BI dashboard to proficiently monitor and dissect online sales data. This dashboard offered an all-encompassing outlook on pivotal sales metrics and performance benchmarks. Complex parameters were skillfully integrated to empower users to meticulously explore specific data subsets within the dashboard. By incorporating filters and slicers, customization options were seamlessly embedded, allowing users to tailor their analytical approach. Moreover, the undertaking mandated the establishment of connections, integration of new tables, and execution of data computations to refine and elevate the dataset. This groundwork paved the way for user-centric parameters to steer visualizations, culminating in a more dynamic and bespoke analytical encounter. A plethora of tailored visualizations, spanning bar, pie, donut, clustered bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs, area charts, maps, and slicers, were harnessed to present sales data in a coherent, visually compelling manner. At its core, the project aspired to offer an exhaustive online sales analysis solution via an instinctive and interactive Power BI dashboard.
