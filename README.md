# Ecommerce_Sales_Dashboard_PowerBI

Project Description:-

The project involved the creation of an interactive dashboard using Power BI to effectively track and analyze online sales data. The dashboard provided a comprehensive view of key sales metrics and performance indicators. Complex parameters were implemented to allow users to drill down into specific data within the dashboard. Customization options were incorporated through the use of filters and slicers, enabling users to tailor their analysis. Additionally, the project required establishing connections, joining new tables, and performing data calculations to manipulate and enhance the dataset. This facilitated the creation of user-driven parameters for visualizations, enabling a more dynamic and tailored analysis experience. Various types of customized visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, area charts, maps, and slicers, were utilized to present the sales data in an easily understandable and visually appealing manner. Overall, the project aimed to provide a comprehensive online sales analysis solution through an intuitive and interactive Power BI dashboard.
